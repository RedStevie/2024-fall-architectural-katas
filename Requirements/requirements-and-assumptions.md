# Requirements

Requirements are numbered. Functional begin with A, non-functional (qualitative) with Q.
Some are based on Assumptions. 

The assumptions are at the bottom and the numbering begins with A.

This is an iterative process: When deleting, do not reorder or reassign numbers but just leave
a gap. Also make sure to maintain the uniqueness of the numbering when adding new entries.

## Non-functional (qualitative) requirements

### Given and implied
- Q1: The resume tips (R3) must be AI generated
- Q3: The automation when entering company information (R3) must be AI generated
- Q3: Stories must contain a human-readable representation of resume information (S.M.A.R.T (Specific, Measurable,
  Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals, qualifications, and experience), as well as a 
condensed representation for quantified comparison with open roles.
- Q6: The creation of a story (R12) must use AI
- Q7: The monthly report for an employer conveys possible disparities between those 
who are hired and those who were not selected.
- Q8: A match between resume and open role must imply similarity / fit
- Q9: Story must be free from racial, lifestyle, and cultural (and potentially further) indicators that lead to unfair biases.
- Q11: The AI is a trained LLM

### Assumed
- Q2, based on A2: Concurrent activity of several hiring managers does not lead to corrupt or faulty data.
- Q5, based on A8 and A9: AI, when matching or evaluating a resume, must only consider its story (anonymized representation)
- Q10, based on A15: Automization of backend processes is applied whenever feasible and cost-efficient


## Assumptions
- A1: An employer may have several hiring managers representing different branches or departments in the company.
- (new) A2: Hiring managers often work together on the same set of open positions.
- A3: Clear view wants to convey a particularly high level of privacy and security
- (new) A4: Some big employers maintain different HR systems for different branches, departments.
- (new) A5: Some small employers have no common HR system or none at all
- A6: Hiring managers prefer a text about a person instead of stories must be human-readable and convey information 
about a candidate
- A7: Decisions made by AI are especially difficult to comprehend and justify.
- A8, based on A7: Existing LLMs contain all kinds of biases, including those ClearView seeks to eliminate.
- A9: A fair hiring process seeks to increase determinism and reduce arbitrariness. 
- A10: AI models can be deterministic, but training leverages randomness. Different versions of models therefore 
quickly lead to different results.
- A11: After an unlock, the hiring process will typically continue and conclude outside from ClearView.
- A12: There are malicious or ambivalent employers
- A13: There are malicious or ambivalent candidates
- A15: Manual labour cost of ClearView employees is high compared to technical cost
- A16: Diversity Cyber Council focuses more than 
- A17: The upper bound of role openings per month in the US is 250'000, based on these statistics
https://www.statista.com/statistics/200003/number-of-job-openings-in-the-us-information-sector/#:~:text=Number%20of%20monthly%20job%20openings%20in%20the%20U.S.%20information%20sector%202005%2D2023&text=As%20of%20May%202023%2C%20the,than%20in%20the%20previous%20years
Assuming reaching a market share of 10%, we need to cater to 25'000 openings per month and around the same number of active candidates.
- A18: The user interaction patterns with the platform are sparse (sporadic use) and with light data loads (mainly text).
- A19: The candidate has a need to get information on their statistic

## Open Questions
- Should user be able to see their story? (Anonymized review)
- How many matches should there be? Is there e dynamic threshold or is it fixed? Influences, if we need a "score"
- Does the action 'hire', mark the moment a person was actually hired, therefore the closure of an open role,
or is it only a status representing, that a candidate entered the next round of the hiring process?
  - We decided the representation of an actual hire is the better decision, since: 
    - it delivers more accurate datapoints for analytics. 'hired' is stronger than 'reaching next round'
    - it does not prematurely interfere with the statuses of candidate and open role
  - although:
    - the incentive of an employer to properly close a role, create acurate statistics is less
      (Unsere Entscheidung widerspricht dem Data Point 1 im Doc)
- If a resume is unlocked, and matched again with a position of the same employer, is the resume free to unlock?
- Contradictions in slides vs. doc:
  - word "resume" vs. "full profile" in an unlock.
  - suddenly it's an interview..
- what is 'solution building services' with executives
- Important!: Matching pre-filtering? Does user need to enter, where they want to apply?
- We did not 
## Notes for later
- A9 & A10 shows a contradiction. Could be a interesting base for an argument
- Idea: Use as little AI as necessary
